# 4. HIGHER-ORDER COMPONENTS IN TYPESCRIPT
------------------------------------------

* Overview of higher-order component (HOCs)
-------------------------------------------
HOCs are functions that take your component and return a new one.

when you have components that are similar but have slight differences this would be an ideal case for it.

We can create a function to create new components where we pass the differences for each and the similarities are created with the HOC.
